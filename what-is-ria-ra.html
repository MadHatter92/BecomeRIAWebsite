    <h1>What is a SEBI Registered RIA/RA?</h1>
    <p>
      In India, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) regulates the investment advisory and research space through two key roles:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs)</strong> are licensed professionals who provide personalized financial advice to individuals. They must follow strict fiduciary standards, meaning they are legally obligated to put their clients' interests first.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Research Analysts (RAs)</strong> are individuals or firms that publish reports or make recommendations on stocks, mutual funds, or other securities. They are required to maintain objectivity and disclose any potential conflicts of interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      To become either an RIA or an RA, one must pass specific NISM exams and register with SEBI, adhering to eligibility and compliance criteria.
